=============


For Ex5: 

$ make all 

$ make test 

# will test Sample.in, if you change Sample.in to something not handled in in the parser.cup <br>
# will return syntax error.

$ make run < javaFile.java # will produce either nothing (success) or syntax error

We should work in parser.cup to include the grammar to satisfy the AP.java (as far as i understand).
