=============


For Ex5: 

    $ make all 
    $ make test 
    # will test Sample.in, if you change Sample.in to something not handled in in the parser.cup
    # will return syntax error.
    $ make run < javaFile.java # will produce either nothing (success) or syntax error according to the grammar in parser.cup
    

We should work in parser.cup to include the grammar to satisfy the AP.java (as far as i understand).
